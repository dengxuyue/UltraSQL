                             Bugs and the fixes
                                -- Bugs are NOT the features should present. They're just bugs.

1. There may be multiple title parcels.
   -- Fixed(?).

2. Multi-line statement are not correctly formatted, the next line is closely appened to the 
   previous line.
   -- Fixed.

3. If a lot of rows/columns are returned, the latter part cannot show.
   -- Fixed.

4. If a huge result set is returned but not shown totally, it takes a long time to iterate on
   remaining rows/columns.
   -- Fixed.

5. Clear text password.
   -- Fixed.

6. Error in parsing .logon: if the first .logon statement executions fails, the subsequent .logon
   statement will get false "syntax error".

7. Create/replace procedure with specified delimiter returns the syntax error 3706
   -- parser should be able to recognize the 'create/replace procedure' type statement
   -- set up APH, the extension area for procedure processing
   -- TODO

8. The following script works improperly:
   
        --------------------BEGIN----------------------------------------
        del database test99;
        drop database test99;

        create database test99 as perm = 10e6;
        grant all on test99 to dbc;

        database test99;

        create table t01(
            t char(8),
            i integer format 'FN9'
        );

        insert into t01('first', 1);
        insert into t01('second', 2);

        select t from t01;
        select i from t01; --- zeros return
        select * from t01; --- db crashes
        --------------------END------------------------------------------
    
    -- Fixed

9. Failure 3115 when query is running against a table with long varchar (e.g. 64000) 
   type column.
